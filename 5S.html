        <h2><b>WHAT IS 5S?</b></h2>
        <div class="ipara">
        5S is a simple tool for organizing your workplace in a clean, efficient and safe manner to enhance your productivity, visual management and to ensure the introduction of standardized working.
Most of the other definitions of 5S and descriptions that I see here on the internet concentrate heavily on the aesthetics and the efficiency gains that you achieve through implementing 5S and neglect the real aim of 5S; the need to introduce standard operational practices to ensure efficient, repeatable, safe ways of working.

In addition to standardised working which provides you with a stable foundation to build all of your other improvements through implementing Lean Tools, you also provide a highly visual workplace. One of the most important factors of 5S is that it makes problems immediately obvious.
5S is a team run process and should be conducted by the people who work within the area in which the principles of 5S are being applied, it is not a tool that can be applied by an outsider onto an area without the knowledge and cooperation of the people within it.

    <h2><b>CONCEPTS OF 5S</b></h2>
    <div class="para">5S is a methodical way to organize your workplace and your working practices as well as being an overall philosophy and way of working. It is split into 5 phases, each named after a different Japanese term beginning with the letter “S”; (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, Shitsuke) hence the name 5 S.
        <br>
        <br><br>
        These five distinct phases are (with English descriptions):

    <h2><b>PURPOSES OF 5S:</b></h2>
    <br>
    <h3><b>SEIRI</b></h3>
    <div class="para">
        Sort, Clearing or Classify are the English equivalents of the Japanese term Seiri within 5S, within this first stage of 5S we aim to remove all unnecessary items from your working environment. This is more than just throwing away the junk within the cell, it is about removing everything that is not required on a regular basis.
Without this additional clutter within your cell you are left with only what you need, reducing the need to search through things to get what you really need or move things out of your way and so on. It is surprising how much can be removed within this stage of 5S
Classify is a term that many forget when implementing 5S, it is not just to remove clutter during this stage, we should also consider the usage requirements of the items within a cell, if things are used daily then they should be located in the cell. If they are required weekly, or monthly then if there is room within the cell then that is where you can keep them if they can be located so as not to cause any delays. Items however that have highly infrequent use may need to be located in a storage area freeing more space within the cell.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><b>SEITON</b></h3>
    <div class="para">
        The purpose of 5S Seiton is to find a place for everything within your working area, everything should be located as close as possible to where it is needed and at a location that is both safe and easily reached.
We are trying to achieve a number of things with this step, we are trying to ensure that the work place is ergonomic; that is it should be arranged in such a way that movements are minimized and made as stress free as possible. We are also trying to ensure safety, something that should be assured through the ergonomic work space but is worth mentioning in its own right. We are also trying to eliminate some of the seven wastes of lean by ensuring that we don’t encounter delays looking for things, waiting and so on.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><b>SEISO</b></h3>
    <div class="para">
        The purpose of 5S Seiso is not to beautify your work place, although it does a good job of doing so. I have been into even machine shops where you feel that you could eat your food from the floor as it was so clean and tidy.
The true reason for 5S Seiso is to make problems obvious; it is a significant part of your visual management. You will not spot an oil leak in an untidy workshop where the oil is leaking onto the absorbent granules still there from the last leak. But in a tidy, newly painted work shop the same leak will stand out like a sore thumb enabling you to take action before the leak becomes a more serious condition.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><b>SEIKETSU</b></h3>
    <div class="para">
        The purpose of 5S Seiketsu is to standardize what you have done within the first three steps of 5S, however there is far more to this than many people think. The true purpose of 5S is not so much about housekeeping but in achieving standard work; ensuring that the most efficient, and least wasteful ways of doing things are performed in a repeatable manner, either through having no other options or through documented work instructions or standard operating procedures (SOPs.)
5S Seiketsu is to standardize your ways of working with regard to the first three stages of 5S and in a general sense with regard to your operations. Without standardized working you will never be able to continuously improve your processes or even trace where errors are occurring.
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><b>SHITSUKE</b></h3>
    <div class="para">
        5S is not a one off exercise, if it were then after a few months your work environment and working practices would fall back to where they were prior to your 5S implementation program; a  situation that I have witnessed far too often over the years.
The purpose of this final stage is to sustain the gains made and make 5S part of your everyday routine in the organization; ensuring that we do not fall back to our old ways and lose all of the 5S Benefits.
